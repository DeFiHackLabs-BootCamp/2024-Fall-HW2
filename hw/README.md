# DeFiHackLabs BootCamp - Week2 Homework

> [!WARNING]
> DO NOT MODIFY THE `SimpleTokenBase.t.sol`, `MagicWalletBase.t.sol` and `DeFiHackLabsVaultBase.t.sol` FILES, OR YOU WILL GET ZERO POINTS FROM THIS CHALLENGE

### Task 1 - Simple Token

Louis, a newcomer in the crypto world, just created his own token called $SimpleToken. He is super excited and believes that his token follows the ERC20 standard to the letter! 💪💪

📌 Upon deployment, the SimpleToken contract mints 100 ether $SimpleToken directly to Louis' wallet. He’s confident that his balance is safe and sound.

But… is it really? 😏😏

Your task is simple: can you figure out a way to take all of Louis' $SIMPLE tokens for yourself? 😈😈

Time to put your skills to the test and show Louis that sometimes, the “Simple” things aren’t so simple after all…

### Task 2 - Magic Wallet

Alice just launched her newest project — MagicWallet. Her goal is to provide users with a seamless way to manage their ETH deposits. 💼💰

📌 Users can deposit ETH into the MagicWallet and let it manage their funds. When needed, they can withdraw their ETH. As an added bonus, Alice even implemented a feature that allows users to transfer their deposits to a friend.

Sounds pretty convenient, right? But is MagicWallet really as secure and reliable as it seems? 🤔🤔

Your task: find a way to drain all the ETH from MagicWallet into your own account… without anyone noticing. 😈💸

Is MagicWallet truly a magical vault, or just an illusionary trap? 🌪️✨

### Task 3 - DeFiHackLabsVault

DeFiHackLabs is a well-known contract security community with members like Alex, Alice, Bill, and Louis, led by their founder, Sun. Recently, they’ve been using their `DeFiHackLabsVault` to vote on how to allocate community funds. 💡💼

📌 After careful consideration, Sun proposes to sponsor the SlowMist community with 2 ETH from the DeFiHackLabsVault. The other members think it’s a great idea and eagerly vote in favor of the proposal!

But little do they know… you’ve discovered a critical vulnerability in the vault. 😈💥

Your mission: exploit the flaw and drain the entire DeFiHackLabsVault of its funds before the voting period ends!

Can you outsmart the experts and empty the vault right under their noses? 🌪️💸
